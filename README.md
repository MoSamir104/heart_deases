# Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has heart disease based on their clinical parameters. We will use various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries to accomplish this task.

## 1. Problem Definition
Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

## 2. Data
The dataset used for this project contains various medical attributes and a target variable indicating whether the patient has heart disease. You can find the dataset in the `data` directory of this repository.

## 3. Evaluation
The model's performance will be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## 4. Features
The features in the dataset include:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Serum cholesterol level
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting electrocardiographic results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression induced by exercise
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- Thallium heart scan results

## 5. Modelling
We will explore various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine to build the predictive model. The dataset will be split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

## 6. Experimentation
Different models will be trained and fine-tuned using techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve performance. We will also experiment with feature engineering and selection to enhance the model's predictive capabilities. Finally, we will compare the performance of different models and choose the best one for deployment.
